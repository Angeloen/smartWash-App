  <h2><center>Hi, Everyone!</center>
    <h4 style="color:LightGray;">I was born in Guadalajara, Mexico. My parents immigrated to the U.S.A when I was 4 years; and because of that
    I was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, California.
    After more than two decades in the USA, in late 2017, I had no other option than to return back to Mexico
    to keep persuing a happy and sucessful future. Thanks to Hola Code I am on my way!</h4>
